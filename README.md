# Battleship w/ Stakes

Early idea for a crypto battleship game
zk-snark where each player registers their ships in a X-Y grid
Players take turns? 
- How async / sync does this need to be? Could someone play all their moves before the other play plays?
- How to make sure the other player actually submits their moves?
-- Penalty for not playing?

Each user mints an NFT(?) for their battleship plan?

How to pair users?
